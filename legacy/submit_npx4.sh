# A simple sh script for submitting one job to the npx4 cluster.
# Simply log into npx4.icecube.wisc.edu, run any command as you normally 
#  would but prepend "./submit-npx4.sh" and the command will be run on the
#  npx4 cluster. For example:
#
# ./submit-npx4.sh root -l -b -q macro.C
#
# This script will create directories to store your execution script, log files,
#  errors, and std output, so you need write permission in the local directory.

# This script creates a script to be executed and another script to submit it.
# The execution script must be available *at time of job execution!*, which may
#  not be until much later and so it's stored in a directory 'npx4-execs'.
# You may occasionally want to 'rm -rf npx4-*' directories if they get big.
# The submission script "2sub.sub" can be discarded immediately.

# This method of passing your job into a bash script as arguments may fail
#  if you have quotes or other special characters

  # Creating output directories
  mkdir -p npx4-execs npx4-logs npx4-out npx4-error

  # Creating execution script, do not delete until job has started!
